# DSM_Toolkit
Experimenting with tools for manipulating/optimising a Dependency Structure Matrix (DSM).

## Background
I found out about this tool from [MIT's Open Course ESD.36 (System Project Management)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/engineering-systems-division/esd-36-system-project-management-fall-2012/)

## Project plan
1. Python replica of DSM code first made by Ronnie E Thebeau (2000) - IN PROGRESS
2. IPython/Jupyter notebook
3. Application of different optimisation algorithms to the problem
